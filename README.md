# Tome Rater

## Capstone Introduction
In	this	capstone,	you	will	create	an	application	called	TomeRater	that allows	users	to	read	and	rate	books.
The	purpose	of	this	capstone	is	to	practice	implementing	and	testing classes	in	Python.	You	will	be	given	speciﬁcations	for	methods	for	5 diﬀerent	classes	that	interact	with	each	other.	To	create	these	methods	you will	use	your	knowledge	of	lists,	loops,	dictionaries,	strings,	control	ﬂow, and	of	course,	basic	Python	syntax!	If	you	need	to	refresh	your	memory	of these	concepts,	go	back	to	these	lessons	in	the	syllabus. 

## Instructions
Run __*populate.py*__ to test functionality of the classes in *TomeRater.py*. There are two lines in *populate.py* that can be uncommented to test error messages for adding a user with an invalid e-mail address and attempting to create a Book instance with an existing ISBN.
